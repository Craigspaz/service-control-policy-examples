## Privileged access control examples

Enforce controls to make sure that your roles and applications are given only privileges which are essential to perform their intended function.

| Included Policy | Rational | 
|------|-------------|
|[Deny creation of access keys for the root user](Deny-creation-of-access-keys-for-the-root-user.json) | The access key for your AWS account root user gives full access to all your resources for all AWS services, including your billing information. You can't reduce the permissions associated with your AWS account root user access key. If you don't already have an access key for your AWS account root user, don't create one unless you absolutely need to. Instead, use the root user to [create an administrative user in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) for daily administrative tasks. Note: An SCP restricts permissions for IAM users and roles in member accounts, including the member account's root user. SCPs have no effect on users or roles in the management account.|
|[Deny the root user from performing actions other than modification to S3 bucket policy](Deny-the-root-user-from-performing-actions-except-S3-bucketpolicy-changes.json)| Consider configuring an administrative user in [AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to perform daily tasks. Restrict use of root user with exceptions for S3 bucket policy changes, if you are frequently locked out of S3 buckets. Refer to [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)|
|[Deny modifications to specific IAM roles](Deny-modifications-to-specific-IAM-roles.json)|Restrict IAM principals in accounts from making changes to specific IAM roles created in an AWS account. This could be a common administrative IAM role created in all accounts in your organization.| 
|[Deny unwarranted IAM users and access key creation](Deny-unwarranted-IAM-users-and-access-key-creation.json)|Restrict creation of access keys for IAM users to a privileged role. Require your human users to use temporary credentials when accessing AWS. You can use an identity provider for your human users to provide federated access to AWS accounts by assuming roles, which provide temporary credentials rather than creating IAM users with long term credentials.Consider protecting your Administrator role using a policy similar to [Deny modifications to specific IAM roles](Deny-modifications-to-specific-IAM-roles.json).|
|[Deny member accounts from leaving your AWS organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples_general.html#example-scp-leave-org)|Restrict users or roles in any affected account from leaving AWS Organizations.|
